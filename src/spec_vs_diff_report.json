  "summary": "The diff adds a React/Tailwind single-page landing page skeleton with topic cards and a sticky nav, plus substantial authentication/actor/query scaffolding and a backend file. Some key BuildRequest details (anchor-based nav and exact footer text/content) are not fully evidenced in the diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Use an anchor-based navigation bar with in-page anchors to the exact section IDs (#share, #trading, #ecommerce, #dropshipping, #importexport).",
      "reason": "Navigation is implemented with <button> elements and a scrollIntoView handler rather than anchor links (e.g., <a href=\"#share\">). This does not match the explicit 'anchor-based navigation bar' requirement.",

      "requirement": "Include five visible content cards with the same headings and paragraph content as the user-provided HTML.",
      "reason": "Only the first card is fully visible and it includes an emoji in the title (\"📈 Share Market\"). The remaining cards/content are truncated, so matching the exact provided HTML content cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
