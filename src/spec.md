# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a static, single-page “Business Development Awareness” landing page in React (TypeScript) styled with Tailwind, matching the provided HTML structure and CSS intent, with anchor navigation to five topic sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page layout with: header (title + subtitle), anchor-based nav, main content with five topic cards, and footer.
- Implement in-page anchor navigation using the exact section IDs: `share`, `trading`, `ecommerce`, `dropshipping`, `importexport`.
- Style the page with a consistent theme in Tailwind to reflect the provided CSS intent (light gray background, navy header/footer, slightly lighter navy nav, centered max-width content, white rounded cards with subtle shadow) and ensure responsive behavior (wrapping nav on small screens).

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a responsive “Business Development Awareness” landing page with a top nav that scrolls to each of the five content sections, and a footer reading “© 2026 Business Awareness | Learn • Grow • Succeed”.
